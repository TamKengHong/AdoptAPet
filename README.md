# About:
This is a website to allow people to browse for breeds of pets they like, favourite them and perhaps adopt them. Uses TheCatAPI to get cat data.

# Features:
1. Random cat images / gifs in the home screen.
2. Ability to search for cat breeds, and giving information + pictures of cats for that breed.
3. Favourites page to check your favourite kitties.

# Tech Stack:
- Frontend Framework: Vue 3 + Nuxt 3
- Styling: Vuetify 3
- Tests: Jest
- Deployment: Vercel

# To run:
1. git clone this repo
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Or just visit the website: https://adopt-a-pet-sand.vercel.app/

# Design Considerations:
Aesthetics (UI/UX) Design: 
- I wanted to make a clean and nice looking, user friendly website. 
- Emphasis is on showing cat pictures to the user, as that is the most important thing the website should have.
- Soft and friendly color palette used.
Code Design:
- Nuxt 3 helps quite a bit with keeping code structure clean and tidy, with pages and components folders.
- Reusable components, easy to understand (hopefully!) code.

# Future Updates:
1. Fully Implement breed search and favourites feature.
2. Update to TypeScript.
3. More testing.
4. Add in Dog API as well.
5. Mobile Improvements.
